The objective of this project was to create and implement an elegant and modern design for a fictional architecture company website, conveying a professional and sophisticated image.

One of the main highlights of the site is navigation through a grid, which transforms into a header for each page. The grid is a CSS grid that uses navigation information to modify the size of each row and column, leaving only the desired image in focus when one of the links is accessed.

For this project, **VueJS** and **Typescript** were used. With the **Nuxt** framework, it was possible to implement efficient page transitions. Additionally, the use of the **SASS** preprocessor allowed for the creation of modular, scalable CSS with high maintainability.

The site is hosted on the **Netlify** platform, which also provides **CI/CD**, enabling continuous integration and automated delivery.
