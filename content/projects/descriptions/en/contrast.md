This project is a web application that allows you to check the contrast level between different colors at once, helping to determine if a color combination has the necessary contrast to meet the [WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/) standards.

You can add, modify, and remove colors using a color picker or by modifying the RGB color representation. Even after closing or restarting the web application, the chosen colors are saved.

A results table displays the contrast values between the foreground and background colors, and whether they meet the contrast limits required by WCAG. The contrast value is displayed in a box that uses the selected colors.
