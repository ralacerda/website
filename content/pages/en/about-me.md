My history with technology started early, as an enthusiast of Linux and Open Source culture. What was a hobby became my profession in 2020, when I began working as a freelance developer. Being self-taught, I learned by doing, taking responsibility for the entire project lifecycle, from client conception to final delivery.

Today, I am a Fullstack Developer at Skylar, where I work end-to-end on building digital products. My role is balanced: I handle everything from optimizing backends (Node, Python) and cloud infrastructure (GCP) to developing high-performance Landing Pages and SPAs (Single Page Applications) with Vue.js.

I am passionate about learning and teaching. I believe knowledge only has value when shared, which is why I maintain this blog, contribute to open-source projects, and lead technical workshops (on DDD, Git, etc.) for my team.

To continue evolving and blending engineering practice with business strategy, I am currently pursuing an MBA in Software Engineering at USP/ESALQ.
