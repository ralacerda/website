From early on, I was a technology, open source, and Linux enthusiast, but it was in 2022 that I developed my first website, created to help promote an event. Despite the challenges, I discovered a passion for programming, especially in web development.

From there, I worked hard to improve my knowledge in the field and prepared for a career change. I completed several personal and freelance projects that helped me consolidate my knowledge and enhance my skills.

I participated in Grupo Botic√°rio's Development Program (FullStack Track), which provided me with a solid foundation in web development and allowed me to develop practical projects.

Currently, I work as a Front End Developer at Skylar, where I can apply my knowledge in developing web systems and landing pages, also leading the creation of a component library for our products, while having the opportunity to explore new technologies such as Generative AI.

With the goal of staying updated and deepening my knowledge, I am pursuing an MBA in Software Engineering at USP/ESALQ, which provides me with a broader vision of software development and enhances my leadership and project management skills.
