I am an Open Source enthusiast and believe in the power of collaboration
and knowledge sharing. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to
contribute to various open source projects, both in terms of code
development and documentation.

One of the projects I had the opportunity to actively contribute to was
Astro. I contributed on multiple occasions to improve and translate the
documentation of this project. Collaborating with the Astro team was a
rewarding experience, and this contribution allowed me to learn not only
about the project itself but also about good documentation practices and
effective communication in open source projects.

Additionally, I have my own projects hosted on GitHub under the MIT
license, which means I am open to external contributions and encourage
the community to fork and learn from my repositories.
